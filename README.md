# 3D-printing-ML-Project
* Conducted 3D printing experiments for data collection.
* Used Regressin ML methods to create Regressor Chain Model, LASSO Linear Model, and K-Nearest Neighbour model.
* Perform error analysis for each model.
* Used model to predict process parameters, analysed results to come up with optimised set of process parameters.
